# Flex Your Frontend Muscles.
Example layout build with flexbox.

## Requirements.
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [gulp] (http://gulpjs.com/): 'npm install gulp -g'

## Quickstart.
  * Run 'npm install' where package.json is located to retrieve required node modules.

## Working with this.
  * I'm using a simple Gulp script so you can get started quick and easy. If you need help to get this up and running, please tweat @hotpizzas, and I will happily help you get started.

### Gulp
  * Type `gulp` from the theme directory to kick off the "serve" task. This watches the scss folder and creates a static server.

## Notes.
  * [Autoprefixer] (https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
    Handles vendor prefixes.

## Enjoy!
